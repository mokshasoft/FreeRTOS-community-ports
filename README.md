# FreeRTOS-community-ports
The unofficial collection of community ports of FreeRTOS

## FreeRTOS
FreeRTOS is one of the leading Real-time operating systems for microcontrollers. It supports a lot
of hardware, but there are a lot of ports out there that don't have gotten into the supported ports
in the [official repo](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS). When looking around the net it is
difficult to find the ports for all other architectures. This is an attempt to collect them all in
one place, instead of having to try to find a link by searching the FreeRTOS Interactive forum.

## Contributing
Please contribute port that you are working on, so they all are found in one place.
